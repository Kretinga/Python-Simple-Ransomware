# Python-Simple-Ransomware

# Explication

What this "ransomware" does is encrypt text files and prohibit the user from seeing the images or videos that were in the path that you specified.

Before running it, look at the encrypt.py file and change the path to whatever you want.

# For usage:
```
python3 encrypt.py
```
